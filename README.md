Engineering Analysis Questions (in your README)
Signal Discipline: How does the binary semaphore synchronize the button task with the system? What happens if the button is pressed multiple times quickly? How might this differ if youâ€™d used a counting semaphore instead?
The binary semaohore sem_emergency_buttons creates a signaling mechanism between the emergency button task and the medical response task. The button task gives gives the semaphore when an emergency call is detected and the medical response task takes the semaphore to process the emergency. When the button is pressed multiple time, the smeaphore can only do one signal at a time meaning those pressed while one is going will be lost to prevent flooding. If a counting semaphore was used instead it would queue multiple emergency calls to ensure not emergency calls are lost during multiple presses and allows it to process each individually which would be a better representation of a real-life emergency. 

Event Flood Handling: When you adjust the potentiometer rapidly above/below threshold, what behavior do you observe with the red LED and console prints? How does the counting semaphore handle multiple signals? What would break if you swapped it for a binary semaphore?
When I rapidly adjust the potentiometer I notice that the red LED blinks everytime it crosses a certain value related to a high or low heartrate.Then the console will print multiple critical alerts being processed with each one queued and processed individually. The counting queue sem_heart_rate_alert with a max que of up to 5 heart rates where xSemaphoreGive() increments the count and xSemaphoreTake() decrements it. If a binary sempahore were used instead it would only hold one alert at a time dropping the ones that come directly after it if already queued. 

Protecting Shared Output: Describe a moment where removing the mutex caused incorrect console behavior or other issues. Why do mutexes matter for protecting output? What real-world failure could occur if logs were interleaved or shared state was modified concurrently?
Removing the medical_log_mutex causes interleave console output where parts of different messages get mixed together along with incomplete status reports and incorrrect medical logs. The mutexes are important because the console UART is shared by multiple tasks and without protection task switching could occur mid-print. In the healthcare systems corrupted logs could prevent medical staff from properly interpreting a patients status, lead to midsdiagnosis and many other issues. 

Scheduling and Preemption: Did task priorities influence system responsiveness as expected? Give one example where a high-priority task preempted a lower one. What happened to the heartbeat during busy periods?
The priority system worked as expected providing the highest immediate response to manual emergencies. When the emergency button is pressed the emergency button imeediately preempts the prority tasks. The emergency call mesage apears immediately after and lower priority task resume after emergency handling. During the 3-second medical response delay teh green LED stops blinking as the system heartbeat is starved while higher priority task continue.

Timing and Responsiveness: The code provided uses `vTaskDelay` rather than `vTaskDelayUntil`. How did delays impact system responsiveness and behavior? Does the your polling rate affect event detection? Would you consider changing any of the `vTaskDelay` rather than `vTaskDelayUntil` - why or why not? Adjust your code accordingly.
The current code uses vTaskDelay because it creates relative delays from the current time which can cause timing drifting or jitter over time. This was used for the emergency button, heart rate monitor and medical response. The polling rates include Heart Rate Monitor at 100ms for good balance of responsiveness and CPU usage, Emergency Button at 10ms for fast polling ensuring immediate emergency response, and Medical Response at 10ms for minimal delay in critical alert processing. For the heart rate monitor vTaskDelayUntil would be better because it would've provided more consistent sampling intervals for accurate monitoring. The reccomended change would be to use TickType_t xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount() and vTaskDelayUntil(&xLastWakeTime, xFrequency) to maintain precise timing intervals essential for medical monitoring accuracy.

Theme Integration: Connect your implementation to your chosen theme. What does each task/LED/semaphore represent in that real-world system? How might synchronization be life-critical in your domain?
In this healthcare system implementation, each component maps directly to real medical equipment where the Heart Rate Monitor task represents continuous patient monitoring systems like ECG and pulse oximetry, the Emergency Button task simulates nurse call systems and patient panic buttons, the Medical Response task coordinates hospital emergency response teams, and the System Heartbeat task indicates medical equipment status. The green LED represents equipment operational status showing "system normal" while the red LED indicates medical alerts like "code blue" emergency indicators, the binary semaphore represents emergency call buttons for single urgent events, the counting semaphore represents medical alert queues for multiple patients needing attention, and the mutex controls medical record access to prevent data corruption. In the healthcare system synchronization can be life critical because delays in things like vitals or missed alerts which could lead to patient deterioration, delayed emergency response and more. 

[Bonus] Induced Failure: Can you create a situation where the system starves one or more tasks? (E.g., block the heartbeat for more than 3 seconds, or drop button events.) What caused it? Leave your code commented in the project with an explanation.
I just a 3 second delay to cause starvation. The starvation happens bevasue the medical response task blocks for 3 seconds while the system heartbeat task cannot run during this period.
